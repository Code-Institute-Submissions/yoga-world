# Yoga World
## Overview
With so many options in the fitness and welbeing sector these days its hard to stand out. And with everyone out there pushing their
own personal ideas this was all about bringing it back to basics and what yoga stands for in general. The idea was to create 
a simplistic but informative website that lets the user decide for themselves. We did not want to push information at them 
but instead give them a simple honest view of the yoga lifestyle and what the studio can provide.
## Description
This website is for a hypothetical yoga studio which aims to provide all the information about the services to new or existing participants.
It will do this by provinding informationon on the types of classes that are held, the 
schedule of the classes and a brief introduction and history of the instructors. All while using 
friendly and emotive imagery and colors.

or why not just bring the whole family including the kids.
#### Bussiness Goals
* To have more intereaction on the website from contact enquiries.

### Structure
The site is seperated with 4 different pages. The home page, schedule page, our team page and contact page.
The nav and footer will provide links to each page clearly labeled so theres no confusion on where to find the
information thats wanted. The address will be in the nav and footer along with the social media links in the footer, both will stay consistent
throughout the site. All pages will have informative info along with inviting colors and images throughout.
### Surface

Each image was selected to give an honest representation of what the user can expect should they visit the studio. 
Include images of the instructors is to help first time users more comfotable before attending having seen an image 
and a brief piece of info about them.
#### Colurs
The maine colour in this website is green (#32a852). This was chosen to give a relaxing earthly feel which encompasses yoga
and tries to immediately put the user at ease.
#### Typography
In this site Acme and Cuprum are used to immediately catch the users eye in the site title and nav pages.

 for the info they want.

 ## Features left to implement
 * You may notice in my wireframe and even in git commits that a book form was added. As I went to create 
 this form i realised it was out of the scope of the course at this point so this would be a future feature left to implement.
 * As well as the book form the functionality of the send button for the forms would also be needed to implement.
