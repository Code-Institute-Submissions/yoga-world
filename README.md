This website is for a hypothetical yoga studio which aims to provide all the information about the services to new or existing participants.
It will do this by provinding informationon on the types of classes that are held, the 
schedule of the classes and a brief introduction and history of the instructors. All while using 
friendly and emotive imagery and colors.

## Features
* The navbar will have the studio name and address as well as all the sites pages clearly
 named in way that best describes what it contains so the user knows exactly where they need to go 
 for the info they want.
 * The  footer will again contain the studio name and address, as well as all the social media links related to 
 the studio to allow the user to have another way to get a feel for the studio and access there social media content.
 It will also have the names and links to the other pages so the user doesnt not need to scroll back to the top preventing any confusion.
 * The home page and the 'Our Team' page will use a combination of images and text to give description to the 
 info as well as having images to make the user feel more comfortable. For example the 'Our Team' pagewill have the images of each
 instructor to make the user feel like they have a connection before ever attending the studio.
 * The home page will also contain an opening background image with a quote and a 'Book Now' button.
 this button wil allow returning users to quickly book a session as it is in the top of the home page.
 * The schedule page will have a table, this will be the studio's fixed schedule and will allow users to see what is availblle on 
 particular days and times to suit their needs.
 * The 'Book/Contact' page will have two forms, one form for users who just want to make an initial contact and may have 
 a query. The other form will be for returning or possibly new users who want to book a session at the studio.
